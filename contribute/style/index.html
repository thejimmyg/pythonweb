                                WebWare</a> style guidelines (however there are 
                                some important differences in approach)</p>
        
                              <a name="Introduction"> 
                              <h2>Introduction</h2>
                              </a> 
                              <p> Style refers to various aspects of coding including 
                                indentation practices, naming conventions, use 
                                of design patterns, treatment of constants, etc. 
                                We aims to maintain fairly consistent coding style 
                                with respect to certain basics as described in 
                                this document. </p>
                              <p> This document is therefore very important for 
                                those who routinely develop using Python Web Project 
                                libraries or who wish to contribute code.</p>
                              <p> Consistent source code style conventions are 
                                important for several reasons: </p>
                              <ul>
                                <li> Consistent conventions reduce the learning 
                                  curve because users know what to expect from 
                                  the API. </li>
                                <li> Python Web Project code is open source resulting 
                                  in many people reading the code in an attempt 
                                  to understand it, extend it and debug it. </li>
                                <li> The Python Web Project consists of tens of 
                                  thousands of lines of source code and will undoubtedly 
                                  continue to grow. </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p> This document divides the conventions into three 
                                major categories: </p>

                              <h2>Syntax and Naming</h2>
                              </a> <a name="SynNaming_MethodsAndAttrs"> 
                              <h3>Methods and Attributes</h3>
                              </a> 
                              <p> Methods and attributes are an important topic 
                                because they are used so frequently and therefore 
                                have an impact on using the classes, learning 
                                them, remembering them, etc. </p>
                              <p> The first thing that is important to understand 
                                is that Python Web Project code is constructed 
                                in an object-oriented fashion. This means it is 
                                esay to delve right into the heart of the code 
                                and create your own classes with slightly different 
                                functionality. Most of the time the interfaces 
                                documented in the documentation are the easiest 
                                to use.</p>
                              <p> The primary advantages of using methods are: 
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                                <li> Method implementations can be changed with 
                                  minimal impact on the users of the class. </li>
                                <li> Subclasses can customize methods to suit 
                                  their needs and still be used in the usual fashion 
                                  (as defined by the superclass). </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>In the case of a method that returns a value, 
                                that value may manifest in several ways: </p>
                              <ol>
                                <li> Stored as attribute. </li>
                                <li> Stored as an attribute, only on demand. (e.g., 
                                  lazy and cached) </li>
                                <li> Computed upon every request. </li>
                                <li> Delegated to another object. </li>
                              </ol>
                              <p> The Python Web Project code stores such information 
                                in attributes. This is different from the approach 
                                you would take in Java or using WebWare for example.</p>
                              <p>The advantages of this approach is that code 
                                is simpler. Writing <tt><code>form.name</code></tt> 
                                is much more intuitive than <code>form.getName()</code> 
                                for example and <code>form.name = 'myForm'</code> 
                                is more intuitive than <code>form.setName('myForm')</code>.</p>
                              <p>Validating the values being set or performing 
                                other operations once a value is set can be done 
                                using the Python 2.2 and above <code><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html">property()</a></code> 
                                built-in function. In this way you gain the advantages 
                                of all the options listed above.</p>
                             
                              <a name="SynNaming_Abbreviations"> 
                              <h3>Abbreviations</h3>
                              </a>
                              <p> Using abbreviations is a common coding practice 
                                to reduce typing and make lines shorter. However, 
                                removing random characters to abbreviate is a 
                                poor way to go about this. For example, <code>transaction</code> 
                                could be abbreviated as <code>trnsact</code> or 
                                <code>trnsactn</code>, but which letters are left 
                                out is not obvious or easy to remember. </p>
                              <p> In Python Web Project code the general rule 
                                is don't abbreviate. If there isn't an extremly 
                                obvious and well-used abbreviation for the word 
                                to be abbreviated then no abbreviation is made. 
                                It doesn't take long to type a few extra characters 
                                but it does take time to think about which characters 
                                need to be left out of an abbreviation.</p>

                              <p> Identifiers often consist of multiple names.

                              <p> Python itself uses all three styles (<code>has_key</code>, 
                                <code>getattr</code>, <code>isSet</code>), but 
                                the Python Web Project uses only the first which 
                                is more readable than the second and easier to 
                                type that the third. </p>
                              <p> This rule also applies to class names such as 
                                <code>AuthDatabase</code> and <code>SessionBase</code>. 
                              <p>If identifiers contain an well known acronym 
                                then the acronym should be considered a lower 
                                case word not upper case as this would confuse 
                                with class names which should always start with 
                                a capital letter. For example<code> sqlToValue()</code> 
                                would be a correct name for a method or function 
                                but <code>SqlToValue()</code> and <code>SQLToValue()</code> 
                                would not be correct. For a class name the acronym 
                                can be used in uppercase eg <code>HTTPServer.</code>

                              <p> Python Web Project Code use classes extensively 
                                for the following reasons:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li> Classes allow for subclassing and therefore, 
                                  a proven method of software extension and customization. 
                                </li>
                                <li> Classes allow for creating multiple instances 
                                  (or objects) to be used in various ways. Examples 
                                  include caching created objects for increased 
                                  performance and created multi-threaded servers. 
                                </li>
                                <li> Classes can provide for and encourage encapsulation 
                                  of data, which gives implementers more freedom 
                                  to improve their software without breaking what 
                                  depends on it. </li>
                              </ul>
                              <p> By using classes, all three options above are 
                                available to the developer on an on-going basis. 
                                By using collections of functions, none of the 
                                above are readily available. </p>
                              <p> Note that making classes in Python is extraordinarily 
                                easy. Doing so requires one line: </p>
                              <code>class Foo(SuperFoo):</code>
                              <p> and the use of <code>self</code> when accessing 
                                attributes and methods. The difference in time 
                                between creating a class with several methods 
                                vs. a set of several functions is essentially 
                                zero.<a name="Structure_ConfigFiles">  </a></p>

                              <p> Several classes in the Python Web Project code 
                                can be thought of in terms of objects keyed by 
                                their name. These objects support dictionary-style 
                                access but also support a functional interface 
                                to the data.</p>
                              <p>For example the <tt>web.form.Form</tt> class 
                                allows the fields to be accessed in two ways <code>form['fieldName']</code> 
                                or <code>form.get('fieldName').</code> Python 
                                Web Project objects do not use attribute style 
                                access. <code>form.fieldName</code> is not used 
                                as it is ambigous whether <code>fieldName</code> 
                                is to be interpreted as a field or an attribute.<a name="MiscNotes">

                                should make them executable by all (<code>chmod

                                CVS will not have execute permissions by default. 
                                Also, that problem cannot be fixed by changing 
                                the permissions and committing. Instead, a support

                              <p> Of course, there are times when the rules are
